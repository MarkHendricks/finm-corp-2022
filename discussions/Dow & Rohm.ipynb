    "### Why does Dow want to buy Rohm and Haas (hereafter simply Rohm)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dow is seeking higher growth, and Rohm has been a long-term target. Dow’s growth strategy relies on reducing their reliance on basic chemicals, (partly through the planned joint venture with KPC,) while simultaneously increasing their production of specialty chemicals. Dow is also interested in preventing their competitor, BASF from acquiring the firm."

    "\n",
    "Rohm has higher gross margins, though lower net margins and asset turnover. Though the book leverage is comparable, the market leverage2 for Dow has spiked due to a plummeting value of market equity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the fraction of 2008 EBIT going to NWC is much lower for Rohm. Dow’s AR spiked in 2008, among other needs for NWC. Still, they have similar cash conversion cycles (shown annually.)"

    "Dow faces numerous conflicting incentives. \n",
    "* Closing\n",
    "    * Dow has what looks to be a weak legal case for getting out of the deal. They have put a lot of their reputation on closing it.\n",
    "    * Dow has been interested in acquiring this unique asset for a long time, and it may present a significant real option value that is worth the short-term financial stress.\n",

    "    * It was a rich bid even before the crisis, and even with the cash to be realized from the failed joint venture. Now with the revised financials, it looks like a huge overpay.\n",
    "    * Dow no longer has capacity for the deal. The cash from the joint venture is no longer a possibility, their credit rating has been lowered, and defaulting on the bridge loan could trigger covenants on all their debt, leading to bankruptcy.\n",
    "    * Dow will have to cut their dividend to fund the acquisition—something management has staked its reputation on not doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rohm\n",
    "    * Rohm’s shareholders and management are aligned in their incentives to wanting this deal. It is a much richer valuation than the stock was even before the crisis, and certainly now.\n",
    "    * Their legal case is strong, and thus the fiduciary duty may be to insist on the full premium.\n",
    "    * Debt holders, (as well as employees and suppliers,) of Rohm will prefer a renegotiation to ensure that the financial viability of the joint venture is not put at risk.\n",
    "    * Were this an all-stock deal, Rohm’s shareholders and management would be much more aligned with Dow."
