    "\n",
    "1. **Depreciation** on the income statement (and cashflow statement) do not match the change in accumulated deprecation on the balance sheet. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The former is substantially larger than the latter. There are a few potential explanations for this.\n",
    "    - Firms may sell assets and their corresponding accumulated depreciation comes off the balance sheet, but the expensed depreciation has already impacted the income statement.\n",
    "    - Firms may be including depreciation and amortization from other accounts in the expensed depreciation line, (such as depreciation to deferred taxes.)\n",
    "\n",
    "   For Apple, it is not clear what explains the discrepancy. In any case, ignore it, and use the depreciation amount on the income statement (and cashflow statement.)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **CapEx** reported in the cashflow statement does not reconcile to the PP&E accounts on the balance sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $\\text{CAPEX}_t = \\text{Gross PPE}_t - \\text{Gross PPE}_{t-1} = \\text{Net PPE}_t - \\text{Net PPE}_{t-1} + \\text{Depreciation}_t$\n",
    "\n",
    "    But this does not reconcile. There are a few possibilities, similar to the potential explanations for mismatched depreciation above.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    If there is a mismatch, typically use the cashflow statement CapEx rather than the imputed CapEx from the PP&E account. The accountants that compiled the CapEx statement should have had access to more detailed information in making this calculation."

    "The PV of the historic distributions are \\\\$67bn, whereas the PV of the historic modeled FCF are \\\\$83bn.\n",
    "\n",
    "But note that there is a difference: the historic distributions have allowed an accumulation of excess cash. So the PV of this excess cash should be added to the PV of the distributions.\n",

    "With that adjustment, the PV of Distributions is \\\\$76bn, which is much closer.\n",

    "While the modeled FCF will not lead to the exact same valuation as the actual distributions, it is a useful model--especially for forecasted financials, where we do not want to take a strong stand on when exactly cash will be distributed as dividends, repurchases, etc."
